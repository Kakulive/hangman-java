# hangman-java
Hangman game created in Java

# Installation
The quickest, simplest and recommended way to play and test the game is to simply clone the repository, open it in your favourite IDE and run the main function of the Main class.

Alternatively you can:
1. Open command line from the main folder /hangman-java
2. Type 'mvn install' to build the project
3. Go to 'target' folder (cd target)
4. Type  java -jar hangman-java-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Please note that the current version supports IDE terminal display and formatting might be off depending on the user shell.

Please bear in mind that both Java and Maven must be using version 17 for the build to work.
